# CFPB Complaint Real-time Processing System

This project builds a system to process consumer complaints from the CFPB in real-time, predict resolution outcomes, and visualize key metrics for monitoring and improvement. It uses Apache Kafka for streaming data, Apache Spark (with Spark NLP) for processing and machine learning, and Apache Superset for visualization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Mission 1 Setup

Execute the setup script to configure the project:

```bash
python mission_1_setup.py
```

This will:
- Create the necessary directory structure
- Configure logging
- Test Spark session
- Display configuration summary

## Development Environment Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Java 8+ (for Spark)
- Apache Spark 3.3.2
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Superset (for later missions)

## Project Missions

   - Set up project structure
   - Prepare development environment

2. **Data Preparation and Schema Definition** (Future)
   - Define data schema
   - Set up data loading mechanisms
   - Prepare historical dataset for training

3. **Preprocessing Pipeline Development** (Future)
   - Create data preprocessing functions
   - Build and test preprocessing pipeline
   - Implement feature extraction and transformation

4. **Model Training** (Future)
   - Implement batch processing for historical data
   - Train logistic regression model
   - Evaluate model performance

5. **Streaming Infrastructure Setup** (Future)
   - Configure Kafka infrastructure
   - Set up streaming data sources
   - Implement checkpoint mechanisms

6. **Real-time Inference System** (Future)
   - Load preprocessing pipeline and trained model
   - Process streaming data from Kafka
   - Apply model and write results back to Kafka

7. **Superset Dashboard Setup** (Future)
   - Install and configure Apache Superset
   - Connect to data sources
   - Configure datasets for visualization

8. **Dashboard Development** (Future)
   - Create visualizations for complaint metrics
