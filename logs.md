I've successfully implemented Mission 1 (Project Setup and Configuration) for the CFPB Complaint Processing System. Here's what I've created:
Project Structure:
Created all required directories: data, models, pipelines, notebooks, src
Set up src as a proper Python package with init.py
Configuration File:
Created config.py with all necessary settings:
File paths for data, models, pipelines
Kafka connection details
Spark parameters
Model settings
Logging configuration
Development Environment:
Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
Implemented utilities for Spark session management
Set up logging configuration
Utility Scripts:
Created spark_utils.py for Spark session management
Created logging_utils.py for logging configuration
Implemented setup.py for directory verification and basic testing
Entry Point:
Created mission_1_setup.py as the main entry point
Documentation:
Created a detailed README.md with setup instructions and project overview
To run the setup, you can execute the mission_1_setup.py script, which will:
Verify and create the necessary directory structure
Configure logging
Test the Spark session
Display a summary of all configurations
This completes Mission 1 as outlined in the requirements, with the implementation provided as Python scripts that could be run from a notebook.

I've successfully implemented Mission 2 (Data Preparation and Schema Definition) for the CFPB Complaint Processing System. Here's what I've created:

1. **Schema Definition**:
   - Created `schema.py` with StructType definitions for all 18 CFPB complaint fields
   - Defined schemas for both raw data and processed data with derived features

2. **Data Loading and Processing**:
   - Implemented `data_utils.py` with functions for:
     - Loading historical data with schema validation
     - Performing data quality checks on critical fields
     - Preprocessing date fields and calculating processing time
     - Engineering the target variable "SuccessfulResolution"
     - Splitting data into training (75%) and test (25%) sets

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Created `mission_2_data_preparation.ipynb` for interactive analysis
   - Implemented data summary functions to analyze distributions
   - Added data visualization for key metrics

4. **Kafka Producer Simulation**:
   - Created a simulation script generator to produce a Kafka producer
   - Set up a mechanism to feed test data into Kafka at a controlled rate (10,000 complaints/minute)

5. **Main Script**:
   - Implemented `mission_2_data_preparation.py` that orchestrates the entire workflow
   - Created sample data for testing in absence of real CFPB data
   - Included comprehensive logging and error handling

This implementation follows the requirements specified in the PR instructions and builds upon the foundation established in Mission 1. The code is designed to be modular, reusable, and maintainable, with clear documentation and error handling throughout.

To run Mission 2, execute the following command:
```bash
python mission_2_data_preparation.py
```

This will process the sample data and prepare it for model training in Mission 3.
