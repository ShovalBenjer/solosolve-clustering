# Types of complaint data we publish
We publish complaints after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first.



## Date received	
The date the CFPB received the complaint. For example, “05/25/2013.”

## Product	
The type of product the consumer identified in the complaint. For example, “Checking or savings account” or “Student loan.”

## Sub-product	
The type of sub-product the consumer identified in the complaint. For example, “Checking account” or “Private student loan.”

## Issue	
The issue the consumer identified in the complaint. For example, “Managing an account” or “Struggling to repay your loan.”

## Sub-issue	
The sub-issue the consumer identified in the complaint. For example, “Deposits and withdrawals” or “Problem lowering your monthly payments.”

## Consumer complaint narrative	
Consumer complaint narrative is the consumer-submitted description of “what happened” from the complaint. Consumers must opt-in to share their narrative. We will not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, and consumers can opt-out at any time. The CFPB takes reasonable steps to scrub personal information from each complaint that could be used to identify the consumer.

## Company public response	
The company’s optional, public-facing response to a consumer’s complaint. Companies can choose to select a response from a pre-set list of options that will be posted on the public database. For example, “Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error.”

## Company	
The complaint is about this company. For example, “ABC Bank.”

## State	
The state of the mailing address provided by the consumer.

## ZIP code	
The mailing ZIP code provided by the consumer. This field may: i) include the first five digits of a ZIP code; ii) include the first three digits of a ZIP code (if the consumer consented to publication of their complaint narrative); or iii) be blank (if ZIP codes have been submitted with non-numeric values, if there are less than 20,000 people in a given ZIP code, or if the complaint has an address outside of the United States).

## Tags	
Data that supports easier searching and sorting of complaints submitted by or on behalf of consumers.

For example, complaints where the submitter reports the age of the consumer as 62 years or older are tagged “Older American.” Complaints submitted by or on behalf of a servicemember or the spouse or dependent of a servicemember are tagged “Servicemember.” Servicemember includes anyone who is active duty, National Guard, or Reservist, as well as anyone who previously served and is a veteran or retiree.

## Consumer consent provided?	
Identifies whether the consumer opted in to publish their complaint narrative. We do not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, and consumers can opt-out at any time.

## Submitted via	
How the complaint was submitted to the CFPB. For example, “Web” or “Phone.”

## Date sent to company	
The date the CFPB sent the complaint to the company.

## Company response to consumer	
This is how the company responded. For example, “Closed with explanation.”

## Timely response?	
Whether the company gave a timely response. For example, “Yes” or “No.”

## Consumer disputed?	
Whether the consumer disputed the company’s response.

## Complaint ID	
The unique identification number for a complaint.

##NOTES
We only share narratives with the consumer’s consent
A consumer complaint narrative is the consumer-submitted description of “what happened” from the complaint. Consumers must opt-in to share their narrative. We will not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, and consumers can opt-out at any time. The CFPB takes reasonable steps to scrub personal information from each complaint that could be used to identify the consumer.

We don’t publish personal information
Personal information submitted as part of a complaint, such as names, contact information, account numbers, social security numbers, and supporting documents, helps the company identify the consumer. This information is not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.
