Project Overview: CFPB Complaint Real-time Processing and Analysis System

This project aims to build a system that processes consumer complaints from the CFPB in real-time, predicts resolution outcomes, and visualizes key metrics for monitoring and improvement. It uses Apache Kafka for streaming data, Apache Spark (with Spark NLP) for processing and machine learning, and Apache Superset for visualization. The system is designed for high throughput (10,000 complaints/minute), fault tolerance, and avoids User Defined Functions (UDFs) for optimal performance.

Mission 1: Project Setup and Configuration

Create a Configuration File (config.py):

Define file paths for: historical data, saved models, preprocessing pipelines, and Spark checkpoint locations.

Configure Kafka connection details: brokers address, input topic name, output topic name.

Set Spark parameters: batch sizes, processing trigger intervals, and maximum messages per trigger (to manage throughput).

Define model training settings and prediction thresholds.

Set Up Project Directory Structure:

Create a main project folder.

Organize subfolders: /data (for data files), /models (for saved models), /pipelines (for preprocessing pipelines), /notebooks (for Jupyter notebooks), and /src (for Python source code files).

Prepare Development Environment:

Install necessary software: Python, Java, Apache Spark (with Spark NLP), Kafka, Jupyter Notebooks, and Apache Superset.

Install Python libraries: PySpark (with MLlib and Spark NLP), Kafka Python client, and any other required libraries.

Configure a Spark session optimized for both batch processing (training) and streaming (inference).

Set up logging for monitoring system activities and errors.

Design the entire system to avoid using User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Spark for better performance and scalability.

Mission 2: Data Preparation and Schema Definition

Define Data Schema:

Create a precise schema (using Spark StructType) that exactly matches the structure of the CFPB complaint data, including all 18 fields and their data types.

Ensure this schema is consistently used across all parts of the project (data loading, preprocessing, streaming, visualization).

Set Up Data Loading Mechanisms:

Create a process to load the historical CFPB complaint data from a JSON file, ensuring schema validation during loading.

Implement data quality checks: verify for missing data in important fields, validate date formats, and confirm categorical values are within expected ranges.

Create a method to simulate real-time streaming data during development: split the historical data into batches and feed them into Kafka at a controlled rate to mimic a live stream.

Note: For a real-world setup, a Kafka Connect connector would be used to ingest data from the CFPB API into Kafka.

Prepare Historical Dataset for Training:

Load the historical data using the defined schema.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data, distributions, and patterns, especially around complaint resolution.

Engineer the "SuccessfulResolution" target variable based on the "Company response to consumer", "Timely response?", and "Consumer disputed?" fields for binary classification.

Document key findings from EDA for model development guidance.

Conceptually divide the historical data into 75% for initial model training and 25% to simulate real-time data flow during development and testing.

Mission 3: Preprocessing Pipeline Development

Create Data Preprocessing Functions (using Spark NLP and MLlib, without UDFs):

Implement advanced text preprocessing for the "Consumer complaint narrative" field using Spark NLP: tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization (using LemmatizerModel), and potentially N-gram generation.

Develop date feature extraction: parse date strings into timestamps, extract time-based features (day of week, month, hour), and calculate time differences (e.g., time to send to company).

Implement categorical feature encoding using Spark MLlib: use StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder for categorical features.

Create feature vector assembly: combine all engineered features (numerical, encoded categorical, text features) into a single feature vector using VectorAssembler.

Build and Test Preprocessing Pipeline:

Construct a modular PySpark Pipeline, chaining together all preprocessing stages (Spark NLP and MLlib components).

Test the pipeline on a small sample of data to ensure it runs correctly and produces expected outputs.

Refine and adjust preprocessing steps as needed based on testing and EDA insights.

Implement Feature Extraction and Transformation (Advanced Features):

Incorporate advanced feature extraction using Spark NLP:

Sentiment analysis of the complaint narrative using SentimentDLModel.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) using NerDLModel to identify key entities in the narrative.

Document embeddings using BertSentenceEmbeddings to capture semantic meaning of the text.

Consider additional derived features based on domain knowledge, such as complaint complexity (word count, etc.).

Implement feature selection techniques (if needed) to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

Document the importance and rationale for each engineered feature.

Finalize the feature set that will be used for model training.

Save and Validate Preprocessing Pipeline:

Save the fully constructed and tested preprocessing pipeline using pipeline.write().overwrite().save().

Create a validation process to test the saved pipeline on new data to ensure it can be loaded and applied correctly.

Document the expected input and output schema of the pipeline.

Create data schema validation tools to ensure data conforms to expected formats throughout the pipeline.

Mission 4: Model Training (Batch Processing)

Implement Batch Processing for Historical Data:

Load the 75% historical dataset (prepared in Mission 2) using the defined schema.

Apply the saved preprocessing pipeline (from Mission 3) to transform the historical data into feature vectors.

Cache the preprocessed data in memory for faster training iterations.

If there's class imbalance in the "SuccessfulResolution" target, consider using stratified sampling techniques.

Split the preprocessed historical data into training and test sets (e.g., 75% training, 25% test) to evaluate model performance.

Train Logistic Regression Model:

Configure a Logistic Regression model in Spark MLlib, specifying "features" as the input feature column and "SuccessfulResolution" as the label column.

Train the Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed historical training data.

Implement cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters (regularization, etc.) to optimize model performance (AUC, accuracy, etc.).

Evaluate Model Performance:

Generate predictions on the historical test dataset using the trained model.

Calculate key binary classification metrics: AUC (Area Under ROC Curve), Accuracy, F1-score to assess model performance.

Generate a confusion matrix to visualize model performance in terms of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.

Analyze feature importance to understand which features are most influential in the model's predictions.

Save Trained Model and Preprocessing Pipeline:

Save the best trained Logistic Regression model (from cross-validation, if used) using model.save().

Save the fitted preprocessing pipeline (after fitting it to the historical data) using pipelineModel.write().overwrite().save(). This fitted pipeline will be used for real-time inference.

Document the model version, training date, hyperparameters, and performance metrics obtained during evaluation.

Create a model registry entry to track model metadata for version control and deployment.

(Conceptual for Multitask Learning): If implementing multitask learning, train separate models for each target variable (Customer Type, Severity, etc.) following a similar batch process.

Mission 5: Streaming Infrastructure Setup

Configure Kafka Infrastructure:

Set up a Kafka broker (or cluster) environment.

Create Kafka input topic (complaints-input) for receiving incoming complaint data.

Create Kafka output topic (complaints-predictions) for publishing model predictions and decisions.

Configure Kafka topic settings: retention policies (how long messages are stored), and partition counts (for parallel processing). Ensure these are sufficient for handling the expected throughput and data volume.

Set up Kafka consumer groups for monitoring and tracking message offsets.

Set Up Streaming Data Sources (Simulation):

Create a Python producer script to simulate real-time complaint submissions to the Kafka input topic.

This script should read from the historical dataset (or a subset) and send data to Kafka at a rate that simulates 10,000 complaints per minute for testing purposes.

Implement basic backpressure handling in the simulation script if needed.

Create basic monitoring tools or logs to track the data flow rate from the producer.

Implement Checkpoint Mechanisms for Spark Streaming:

Configure a checkpoint location for the Spark Structured Streaming application (config.CHECKPOINT_LOCATION). This is crucial for fault tolerance.

Set a checkpoint interval in the Spark Streaming query configuration.

Ensure the checkpoint location is persistent (e.g., on a distributed file system or cloud storage).

Plan recovery mechanisms: in case of streaming job failure, Spark should be able to restart from the last checkpoint and continue processing without data loss.

Implement basic monitoring of checkpoint operations and recovery events.

Mission 6: Real-time Inference System

Load Saved Preprocessing Pipeline and Trained Model:

In the Spark Streaming application, load the fitted preprocessing pipeline from the saved path (PREPROCESSING_PIPELINE_PATH).

Load the trained Logistic Regression model from the saved path (MODEL_PATH).

Verify that the loaded pipeline and model are compatible with the current Spark environment and data schema.

Implement version checking (if model versioning is in place) to ensure the correct model and pipeline versions are being used.

(Conceptual for Multitask Learning): If implementing multitask learning, load all the separately trained models for each target variable.

Create Streaming DataFrame from Kafka:

Set up a Spark Structured Streaming application to read data from the Kafka input topic (KAFKA_INPUT_TOPIC).

Configure Kafka connection parameters (brokers, topic, starting offsets, etc.).

Set stream processing parameters: maxOffsetsPerTrigger (to control throughput) and processing time trigger interval (e.g., 6 seconds) to manage latency and resource usage.

Implement basic error handling for malformed messages received from Kafka.

Parse and Process Incoming JSON Data:

Parse the JSON data received from Kafka messages into a Spark DataFrame using from_json and the defined schema.

Add a unique identifier (row_id) to each record in the stream for tracking and potential joining later.

Implement schema validation for the incoming streaming data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.

Handle missing fields or invalid data types gracefully in the streaming pipeline.

Implement robust error handling for JSON parsing failures and other data quality issues in the stream.

Apply Preprocessing and Model Inference in Real-time:

Apply the loaded preprocessing pipeline to the streaming DataFrame to perform feature engineering in real-time, ensuring consistency with the batch training pipeline.

Apply the loaded trained Logistic Regression model to the preprocessed streaming data to generate real-time predictions for "SuccessfulResolution".

Verify that all required features are available and correctly processed in the streaming context.

Implement feature vector validation before applying the model to catch any data inconsistencies before inference.

Implement Decision Logic Based on Predictions:

Create business rules to interpret the model's prediction scores and make decisions. For example, set a threshold for the prediction score to determine if a complaint should be escalated.

Add contextual flags or business logic to handle special cases or incorporate business-specific routing rules based on predictions and other complaint features.

(Conceptual for External Validation Rules): Consider how external validation rules (e.g., from a rules engine or external service checking against CFPB regulations) could be conceptually integrated into this decision logic, although actual real-time integration within the Spark Streaming pipeline might be complex and potentially handled in a separate process or batch validation step.

Format and Write Results Back to Kafka:

Select the relevant output columns (including row_id, prediction, decision flags, original features if needed) from the processed streaming DataFrame.

Format the output data into a suitable format (e.g., JSON) for downstream consumption.

Configure the Spark Streaming query to write the processed results back to the Kafka output topic (KAFKA_OUTPUT_TOPIC).

Set up monitoring to track the stream's output progress and data flow to Kafka.

Implement error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable delivery of prediction results to Kafka, in case of Kafka connection issues or other output failures.

Control and Monitor Stream Processing:

Implement graceful termination handling for the Spark Streaming application, allowing for controlled shutdowns.

Create a monitoring dashboard (e.g., using Grafana or custom tools) to visualize key stream processing statistics (throughput, latency, error rates, Kafka consumer lag, etc.).

Implement automated alerts to notify operators of processing delays, failures, or performance degradation.

Set up mechanisms to automatically restart terminated streaming jobs or manually trigger restarts in case of failures.

Mission 7: Superset Dashboard Setup

Install and Configure Apache Superset:

Set up a Superset environment (using a Python virtual environment is recommended).

Install Superset and its dependencies.

Initialize the Superset database and create an admin user.

(Optional) Load example dashboards and data in Superset for initial exploration.

Initialize Superset roles and permissions for security.

Connect Superset to Data Sources:

Recommended Approach: Connect Superset directly to the complaints-predictions Kafka topic. This enables low-latency, real-time visualization of streaming prediction results (the exact steps might vary based on Superset version and Kafka connector capabilities).

(Alternative, Less Real-time): If direct Kafka connection is not feasible, use Kafka Connect JDBC Sink to write the prediction results from Kafka to a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Then, connect Superset to this database. (This approach introduces more latency).

Create a separate database connection in Superset for the historical complaint data (e.g., connecting to the JSON file directly or a database containing historical data).

Name the data source connections descriptively (e.g., "Real-time Complaints (Kafka)", "Historical Complaints").

Configure Datasets for Visualization in Superset:

Create a Superset dataset for the real-time complaint prediction data, pointing to the configured Kafka topic (or JDBC sink table). Configure schema parsing for JSON data from Kafka if needed.

Create a Superset dataset for the historical complaint data, pointing to the historical data source.

For both datasets, configure column data types in Superset to match the data (set timestamp columns to DATETIME, numeric columns to appropriate numeric types, geographic columns to geo types).

Create calculated columns in Superset datasets to derive useful metrics for visualization, such as "Resolution time", "Escalation rate", "Satisfaction score", and conceptually "Validity Rate" (if external validation is implemented).

Mission 8: Dashboard Development in Superset

Create Basic Visualizations for Complaint Metrics:

Build time series charts to visualize complaint volumes over time, broken down by product, etc.

Develop geographic visualizations (US map charts) to show complaint distribution by state, and potentially overlay other metrics like average resolution score.

Create bar charts or similar visualizations to break down complaints by product, sub-product, and other categorical dimensions.

If sentiment analysis is implemented, create pie charts or bar charts to visualize the distribution of sentiment categories in complaint narratives.

Implement Real-time and Historical Data Blending in Dashboards:

Add time-based filters to the Superset dashboard to allow users to filter data by time range and focus on real-time or historical views.

Configure joint visualizations that blend both real-time and historical data on the same charts. For example, create time-series charts that show historical trends overlaid with the latest real-time data points.

Use visual indicators (different colors, annotations) in charts to clearly distinguish between historical and real-time data sources.

Set up auto-refresh for the dashboard (or specific charts within the dashboard) to dynamically update with new data from the real-time stream. Aim for a refresh interval that aligns with the Kafka streaming rate (e.g., 1 minute).

Consider leveraging the row_id (if passed to Superset) for more complex data blending or joining in Superset if needed, but time-based blending and implicit blending in time-series charts might be sufficient for many real-time dashboard use cases.

Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Dashboard:

Create KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards to display key metrics at-a-glance, such as total complaints processed, current complaint rate, average resolution prediction score, escalation percentage, and conceptually, average validity score (if available). Configure KPI cards to show comparisons to previous time periods to highlight trends.

Implement alert threshold visualizations, such as gauge charts, to visually represent system performance metrics (e.g., processing rate, latency) and highlight when metrics fall outside acceptable ranges (e.g., using color-coding for green, yellow, red thresholds).

Build a dedicated performance monitoring section in the dashboard with time-series charts to track metrics like processing latency, Kafka consumer lag, error rates in the streaming pipeline, and model prediction distributions over time.

Develop an executive summary view within the dashboard, providing a high-level overview of key KPIs. Include drill-down capabilities to allow users to investigate detailed metrics from the summary view. Optionally, configure email reports to automatically send summary data to stakeholders on a regular schedule.

Mission 9: System Monitoring and Optimization

Set Up Throughput Monitoring:

Enable Spark metrics collection to expose Spark application performance metrics.

Implement custom throughput metrics within the Spark Streaming application to specifically track complaints processed per minute, batch sizes, and processing rates.

Develop throughput dashboards in Grafana (or a similar monitoring tool) to visualize these throughput metrics over time. Configure alerts in Grafana to trigger notifications if processing rate falls below the target of 10,000 complaints per minute.

Focus monitoring on end-to-end system throughput, not just individual batch processing rates within Spark.

Implement Kafka Monitoring:

Enable Kafka metrics collection within the Kafka broker to monitor Kafka server health and performance.

Configure consumer group monitoring to track consumer lag for the Spark Streaming application's consumer group. Set up alerts if consumer lag exceeds acceptable thresholds.

Implement monitoring of Kafka topic throughput to track message rates for the input and output topics.

If using Kafka Connect, develop monitoring for the Kafka Connect connectors to track their status and health.

Optimize Streaming Parameters for Performance:

Tune Spark executor configuration (number of executors, cores per executor, executor memory) to optimize resource allocation for the streaming workload.

Optimize Kafka consumer parameters within the Spark Streaming application (e.g., maxOffsetsPerTrigger, fetch.min.bytes, fetch.max.wait.ms) to balance throughput and latency.

Tune the Spark Streaming trigger interval (processingTime) based on latency requirements and observed system performance.

(Conceptual Adaptive Parameter Tuning): Explore and potentially implement (conceptually) adaptive parameter tuning strategies to dynamically adjust maxOffsetsPerTrigger or processingTime based on real-time throughput and latency metrics. This would aim to automatically optimize performance under varying load conditions. (Note: actual dynamic parameter adjustment in Spark Streaming is complex and might require external control loops or Spark's dynamic allocation features).

Monitor Overall System Health:

Implement JVM and system monitoring to track JVM metrics, CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network I/O for the Spark Streaming application and Kafka brokers.

Set up log aggregation and analysis using tools like ELK stack or similar to centralize logs from all components (Spark application, Kafka brokers, etc.) for easier troubleshooting and error analysis.

Implement data quality monitoring within the Spark Streaming application to detect data anomalies, missing fields, unusual patterns in predictions, and processing error rates in real-time. Set up alerts for data quality issues.

Configure resource utilization monitoring to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Implement alerts for high resource utilization levels.

Specifically monitor the overall health and error rates of the Spark Streaming application itself.

Mission 10: Testing and Validation

Test End-to-End Pipeline:

Develop an integration test suite to validate the complete end-to-end data pipeline, from Kafka input to Kafka output.

Create component-level tests to isolate and test individual modules of the system (e.g., preprocessing pipeline, model inference logic) for unit-level robustness.

Implement fault injection testing to validate the system's fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms. This should include testing scenarios like sending malformed data to Kafka, simulating Kafka broker failures, and verifying that the system recovers and continues processing valid data without data loss.

Document all testing procedures and record the results of each test case, including status (pass/fail), performance metrics (throughput, latency), and any notes or observations.

Specifically test the error handling mechanisms within the streaming pipeline to ensure they are robust and handle unexpected data or system issues gracefully.

Validate Model Accuracy and Performance in Real-time:

Implement an A/B testing framework to compare new model versions against the current production model in a live environment. Configure A/B tests to split traffic between model versions and track key metrics for each.

Create model accuracy monitoring in the real-time streaming environment to continuously track model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) over time. Set up alerts for model drift or performance degradation.

Implement model versioning and tracking to manage different model versions, track their training dates, performance metrics, deployment status, and enable rollback to previous versions if needed.

Create a performance benchmarking framework to quantify model latency, throughput, and resource consumption under different load conditions.

Ensure System Handles Target Load (Load Testing):

Create a load testing framework to rigorously test the system's ability to handle the target throughput of 10,000 complaints per minute and sustained high load.

Run load tests at the target rate (10,000 complaints/minute) for a defined duration (e.g., 10 minutes or longer).

During load tests, monitor system performance metrics (throughput, latency, resource utilization, error rates) to identify bottlenecks and validate that the system can sustain the target load without performance degradation.

Document the load testing results and performance benchmarks achieved, including actual throughput rates, latency measurements, resource utilization, and any observed issues or limitations.

Ensure load tests simulate realistic data volume and velocity, and validate the end-to-end system performance, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model inference, and output to Kafka, under the target load.

These instructions provide a comprehensive, non-code overview of all the steps needed to build the CFPB complaint processing system, covering setup, data handling, model building, streaming, visualization, monitoring, and testing. Remember that this is a complex project, and each mission will require detailed planning and implementation.
